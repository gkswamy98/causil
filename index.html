  We focus in imitation learning in the presence of temporally correlated perturbations (exogenous noise, <i>(a)</i>) or not having access to the full state (endogenous noise, <i>(b)</i>). We formalize both in a graphical model <i>(c)</i> that allows us to leverage a technique known as <i>instrumental variable regression</i> to find a policy that isn't corrupted by spurious correlations introduced by the confounder.

    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p style="width: 80%;">

We develop algorithms for imitation learning from policy data that was corrupted by unobserved confounders. Sources of such confounding include <i>(a)</i> persistent perturbations to actions or <i>(b)</i> the expert responding to a part of the state that the learner does not have access to. When a confounder affects multiple timesteps of recorded data, it can manifest as spurious correlations between states and actions that a learner might latch onto, leading to poor policy performance. To break up these spurious correlations, we apply modern variants of the classical <i>instrumental variable regression</i> (IVR) technique, enabling us to recover the causally correct underlying policy <i>without</i> requiring access to an interactive expert. In particular, we present two techniques, one of a generative-modeling flavor (<code>DoubIL</code>) that can utilize access to a simulator and one of a game-theoretic flavor (<code>ResiduIL</code>) that can be run entirely offline. We discuss, from the perspective of performance, the types of confounding under which it is better to use an IVR-based technique instead of behavioral cloning and vice versa. We find both of our algorithms compare favorably to behavioral cloning on a simulated rocket landing task.    </p>
